## *Welcome to my Javascript Math workshop from Platzi ðŸ’š*
In this project I implemented javascript DOM manipulation, mobile first workflow in CSS (using grid and flexbox extensively) and semantic HTML. It's the final assignment in such course.

I'd like to thank my teachers and [Platzi](https://platzi.com/) for all the knowledge shared through their lectures:
